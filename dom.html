    <h4>What is callback function and why will you use it?</h4>
    <p>A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.
    I will use it because
    When I want one function to execute only after another function has completed its execution, I use callback functions in JavaScript. It needs to pass as a parameter to other functions to make a function callback
